## 🚀 How to Run Locally (Frontend)

1. Open terminal and navigate into frontend folder:
''bash
cd DayDreamer
Install dependencies:

''bash
npm install
Start local development server:

''bash
npm run dev
App will run on:

arduino
http://localhost:5173
🧠 How to Start Backend (via Google Colab)
Open this notebook in Google Colab:

👉 https://colab.research.google.com

Upload or open your notebook (e.g., Untitled1.ipynb).

Run all the cells in the notebook in order. This will:

Install dependencies (Flask, flask-cors, diffusers, etc.)

Load your pretrained model from /my_model

Start the Flask server on port 5000

Expose it via ngrok (e.g., https://abc123.ngrok-free.app)

Copy the public ngrok URL printed in the output.

Open your React frontend project:

Navigate to: src/components/ImageGenerator.jsx

Replace the backend API URL (in fetch) with the new ngrok URL:

Example:

js
const response = await fetch("https://abc123.ngrok-free.app/generate", {
Save the file and refresh your frontend browser (localhost:5173 or Netlify-deployed link).

✅ You’re now connected to your backend!

🧪 Sample Prompt Ideas
Try these for stunning results:

A mystical forest with glowing mushrooms

Cyberpunk neon street at night

Whimsical underwater tea party

Vintage robot reading newspaper

💾 Save Generated Images
After an image is generated, you’ll see a 💾 Save Image button to download it locally.

🎨 Styling
All components are styled with Bootstrap + custom CSS to create a soft pastel, dreamy look. Fonts used:

Quicksand (main font)

Great Vibes (titles)

Nunito/Poppins (inputs and buttons)

❗ Notes
You must run the Colab backend every time before using the app.

The ngrok link changes every session.

Make sure your ngrok link is whitelisted in CORS (handled by flask_cors).
